# Color

Reserved palette. Every color has a meaning. **Decorative color is forbidden.**

## Surfaces (neutral)

| token         | hex       | use                                     |
| ---           | ---       | ---                                     |
| `--bg`        | `#fafaf8` | page background — warm near-white       |
| `--surface`   | `#ffffff` | cards, panels, table cells              |
| `--surface-2` | `#f4f5f3` | table headers, KPI notes, subtle elevation |
| `--surface-3` | `#eef0ee` | tertiary surface                        |

## Ink

| token        | hex       | use                            |
| ---          | ---       | ---                            |
| `--ink`      | `#0e1116` | primary text, hard borders     |
| `--ink-2`    | `#3a414a` | body prose, secondary text     |
| `--ink-3`    | `#5b6470` | labels, captions               |
| `--muted`    | `#8a939e` | meta, placeholders             |
| `--rule`     | `#dde1e3` | card borders, dividers         |
| `--rule-faint` | `#e9ebe9` | row separators, internal dividers |

## Anchor — water identity

| token       | hex       | use                                              |
| ---         | ---       | ---                                              |
| `--teal`    | `#0f6b7a` | section number, links, actions, brand badges     |
| `--teal-2`  | `#0c5664` | hover/pressed states                             |
| `--teal-tint` | `#e6f0f2` | "for action" callout backgrounds                |
| `--teal-tint-2` | `#d4e3e6` | subtle teal borders                           |

The teal is the only non-grayscale color that may be used decoratively. It signals the document's identity as a **water authority** publication. Use sparingly — section header numbers, key action callouts, primary CTAs. Do not flood the page in it.

## Semantic — exclusive use

These colors have specific, restricted meanings. They are **never** decorative.

### `--red` (`#c0392b`)

Use for ONE of:
- Exceedance of standard (e.g. `101% מהתקן`)
- Monitoring gap (silent borehole, missing PFAS coverage)
- Critical urgency tag on findings
- "Rising trend" warning

**Never** use red for: emphasis, headings, decorative borders, link accents.

### `--green` (`#1f7a4d`)

Use for ONE of:
- Remediation success (e.g. Remital × 57 ↓)
- "Confirmed safe" status
- Successful intervention marker

**Never** use green for: navigation, action buttons, "GO" affordances, decoration.

### `--amber` (`#b87333`)

Use for ONE of:
- Framing warnings ("selection bias caveat")
- Methodology caveats
- "High urgency but not critical" finding tag

**Never** use amber for: highlights, callouts, brand accent.

## Severity scale (matrix only)

The `s0`–`s8` scale colors the severity matrix cells. They are **only** used in the matrix and (mapped) in the Leaflet map markers.

| token | hex       | meaning                          |
| ---   | ---       | ---                              |
| `s0`  | transparent | not sampled                    |
| `s1`  | `#f4f5f3` | undetected                       |
| `s2`  | `#e6e8e6` | trace                            |
| `s3`  | `#d2d6d5` | low                              |
| `s4`  | `#b7bdbd` | moderate                         |
| `s5`  | `#8a8f8f` | elevated                         |
| `s6`  | `#5a564f` | high                             |
| `s7`  | `#962618` | very high                        |
| `s8`  | `#c0392b` | exceedance / max                 |

Computed via `bucket(C_max_5y / DWS × 100)` — see `voice.md` for the formula.

## Forbidden

- Pure black (`#000`). Use `--ink` (`#0e1116`).
- Pure white. Use `--bg` (`#fafaf8`) or `--surface` (`#ffffff`) as appropriate.
- Bright/saturated red beyond `--red`. The brand red is desaturated for trust.
- Any hue outside this palette. **No exceptions without human approval.**
- Gradients. The document is flat by design.
- Drop shadows beyond the subtle ones in popups/markers (1–3% opacity).
